# Project Brief: Data Synchronization and Virtual Assistant Platform

## Overview

This project aims to develop a platform that enables data collection and synchronization from various software systems' databases and public APIs into a data warehouse, with an integrated virtual assistant for data querying.

## Core Requirements

### Data Synchronization

1. Implement data synchronization from source databases using:
   - Batch processing
   - Real-time CDC (Change Data Capture)
2. Design an efficient data warehouse structure for:
   - Easy data exploitation
   - Simple operation for both data analysts and regular users
3. Implement data visualization and reporting capabilities
4. Build a virtual assistant API for data querying

### Timeline

- Week 1: ETL Research & Requirements Analysis
- Week 2: Data Synchronization Implementation
- Week 3: Dashboard & Data Glossary Development
- Week 4: API Development
- Week 5: Documentation & Reporting

## Success Criteria

1. Successful implementation of real-time data synchronization
2. Efficient data warehouse design
3. Functional dashboard and data glossary
4. Working virtual assistant API
5. Comprehensive documentation
