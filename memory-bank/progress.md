# Progress Report

## Latest Updates (2024-05-23)

### Completed Tasks

1. Fixed Flink CDC Consumer issues:

   - Added jackson-datatype-jsr310 dependency to support Java 8 date/time types
   - Configured ObjectMapper in CDCConsumer and CDCMessage classes to handle timestamps
   - Improved error logging in CDCMessage class
   - Set up proper logging configuration with log4j

2. Fixed TaskManager memory configuration:

   - Adjusted JVM Overhead range to accommodate actual memory needs
   - Increased total process memory from 1600MB to 2048MB
   - Rebalanced memory allocations across different components

3. Improved logging system:
   - Added log4j.properties configuration
   - Configured both file and console appenders
   - Set appropriate log levels for different packages
   - Added proper log file rotation and size limits

### Current Status

- Flink CDC Consumer is now properly handling timestamp fields from PostgreSQL
- TaskManager memory issues have been resolved
- Logging system is properly configured and working
- Data generator is working as expected with basic timestamp handling

### Known Issues

1. Data Generator timestamp handling:
   - Currently not explicitly handling created_at and updated_at fields
   - May need to add timestamp support in future if CDC requirements change

### Next Steps

1. Consider enhancing Data Generator:

   - Add proper timestamp handling for created_at and updated_at fields
   - Implement more sophisticated data generation patterns
   - Add more diverse test scenarios

2. Monitor Flink CDC Consumer:
   - Watch for any memory-related issues
   - Ensure log rotation is working as expected
   - Verify timestamp handling across all table types
