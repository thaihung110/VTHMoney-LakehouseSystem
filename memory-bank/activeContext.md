# Active Context

## Current Focus

1. Flink CDC Consumer Stability

   - Timestamp handling improvements
   - Memory optimization
   - Logging system enhancement

2. Data Generator Functionality
   - Basic data generation working
   - Timestamp fields handled by PostgreSQL
   - Potential future enhancements for timestamp management

## Recent Changes

1. Flink CDC Consumer:

   - Added jackson-datatype-jsr310 for proper timestamp handling
   - Configured ObjectMapper in both CDCConsumer and CDCMessage
   - Improved error logging and messages
   - Added log4j configuration

2. TaskManager Configuration:

   - Increased total memory to 2048MB
   - Adjusted memory allocation for different components
   - Fixed JVM Overhead issues

3. Logging System:
   - Implemented comprehensive log4j configuration
   - Added both file and console logging
   - Configured log rotation

## Active Decisions

1. Timestamp Handling:

   - Decision: Use UTC timezone consistently across the system
   - Rationale: Ensures consistency and prevents timezone-related issues
   - Implementation: Using Java 8 date/time API with jackson-datatype-jsr310

2. Memory Management:

   - Decision: Explicit memory configuration for Flink components
   - Rationale: Prevents memory-related issues and optimizes performance
   - Implementation: Detailed memory allocation in TaskManager configuration

3. Logging Strategy:
   - Decision: Comprehensive logging with rotation
   - Rationale: Better debugging and monitoring capabilities
   - Implementation: log4j with file and console appenders

## Current Considerations

1. Data Warehouse Selection

   - Evaluating options
   - Considering scalability requirements
   - Performance characteristics needed

2. Virtual Assistant Implementation

   - API design planning
   - Query processing approach
   - Integration strategy

3. Infrastructure Setup
   - Container orchestration
   - Service communication
   - Monitoring requirements

## Next Steps

1. Monitor system stability with new changes
2. Consider enhancing Data Generator timestamp handling
3. Add more comprehensive testing scenarios
4. Document best practices for timestamp handling

## Open Questions

1. Data warehouse technology selection
2. Virtual assistant query processing approach
3. Performance optimization strategies
4. Monitoring and alerting requirements
